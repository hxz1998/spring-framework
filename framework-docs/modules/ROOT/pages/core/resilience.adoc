[[resilience]]
= Resilience Features

As of 7.0, the core Spring Framework includes common resilience features, in particular
<<resilience-annotations-retryable>> and <<resilience-annotations-concurrencylimit>>
annotations for method invocations as well as <<resilience-programmatic-retry,
programmatic retry support>>.


[[resilience-annotations-retryable]]
== `@Retryable`

{spring-framework-api}/resilience/annotation/Retryable.html[`@Retryable`] is an annotation
that specifies retry characteristics for an individual method (with the annotation
declared at the method level), or for all proxy-invoked methods in a given class hierarchy
(with the annotation declared at the type level).

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

By default, the method invocation will be retried for any exception thrown: with at most 3
retry attempts after an initial failure, and a delay of 1 second between attempts.

This can be specifically adapted for every method if necessary – for example, by narrowing
the exceptions to retry:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable(MessageDeliveryException.class)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

NOTE: `@Retryable(MessageDeliveryException.class)` is a shortcut for
`@Retryable(includes{nbsp}={nbsp}MessageDeliveryException.class)`.

Or for 5 retry attempts and an exponential back-off strategy with a bit of jitter:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable(
  includes = MessageDeliveryException.class,
  maxAttempts = 5,
  delay = 100,
  jitter = 10,
  multiplier = 2,
  maxDelay = 1000)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

Last but not least, `@Retryable` also works for reactive methods with a reactive return
type, decorating the pipeline with Reactor's retry capabilities:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Retryable(maxAttempts = 5, delay = 100)
public Mono<Void> sendNotification() {
    return Mono.from(...); // <1>
}
----
<1> This raw `Mono` will get decorated with a retry spec.
	
For details on the various characteristics, see the available annotation attributes in
{spring-framework-api}/resilience/annotation/Retryable.html[`@Retryable`].

TIP: Several attributes in `@Retryable` have `String` variants that provide property
placeholder and SpEL support, as an alternative to the specifically typed annotation
attributes used in the above examples.


[[resilience-annotations-concurrencylimit]]
== `@ConcurrencyLimit`

{spring-framework-api}/resilience/annotation/ConcurrencyLimit.html[`@ConcurrencyLimit`] is
an annotation that specifies a concurrency limit for an individual method (with the
annotation declared at the method level), or for all proxy-invoked methods in a given
class hierarchy (with the annotation declared at the type level).

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@ConcurrencyLimit(10)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----

This is meant to protect the target resource from being accessed from too many threads at
the same time, similar to the effect of a pool size limit for a thread pool or a
connection pool that blocks access if its limit is reached.

You may optionally set the limit to `1`, effectively locking access to the target bean
instance:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@ConcurrencyLimit(1)
public void sendNotification() {
    this.jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...);
}
----
	
Such limiting is particularly useful with Virtual Threads where there is generally no
thread pool limit in place. For asynchronous tasks, this can be constrained on
{spring-framework-api}/core/task/SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.html[`SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor`].
For synchronous invocations, this annotation provides equivalent behavior through
{spring-framework-api}/aop/interceptor/ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor.html[`ConcurrencyThrottleInterceptor`]
which has been available since Spring Framework 1.0 for programmatic use with the AOP
framework.

TIP: `@ConcurrencyLimit` also has a `limitString` attribute that provides property
placeholder and SpEL support, as an alternative to the `int` based examples above.


[[resilience-annotations-configuration]]
== Enabling Resilient Methods

Like many of Spring's core annotation-based features, `@Retryable` and `@ConcurrencyLimit`
are designed as metadata that you can choose to honor or ignore. The most convenient way
to enable processing of the resilience annotations is to declare
{spring-framework-api}/resilience/annotation/EnableResilientMethods.html[`@EnableResilientMethods`]
on a corresponding `@Configuration` class.

Alternatively, these annotations can be individually enabled by defining a
`RetryAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` or a `ConcurrencyLimitBeanPostProcessor` bean in the
context.


[[resilience-programmatic-retry]]
== Programmatic Retry Support

In contrast to <<resilience-annotations-retryable>> which provides a declarative approach
for specifying retry semantics for methods within beans registered in the
`ApplicationContext`,
{spring-framework-api}/core/retry/RetryTemplate.html[`RetryTemplate`] provides a
programmatic API for retrying arbitrary blocks of code.

Specifically, a `RetryTemplate` executes and potentially retries a
{spring-framework-api}/core/retry/Retryable.html[`Retryable`] operation based on a
configured {spring-framework-api}/core/retry/RetryPolicy.html[`RetryPolicy`].

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    var retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate(); // <1>

    retryTemplate.execute(
            () -> jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...));
----
<1> Implicitly uses `RetryPolicy.withDefaults()`.

By default, a retryable operation will be retried for any exception thrown: with at most 3
retry attempts after an initial failure, and a delay of 1 second between attempts.

If you only need to customize the number of retry attempts, you can use the
`RetryPolicy.withMaxAttempts()` factory method as demonstrated below.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    var retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate(RetryPolicy.withMaxAttempts(5)); // <1>

    retryTemplate.execute(
            () -> jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...));
----
<1> Explicitly uses `RetryPolicy.withMaxAttempts(5)`.

If you need to narrow the types of exceptions to retry, that can be achieved via the
`includes()` and `excludes()` builder methods.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    var retryPolicy = RetryPolicy.builder()
            .includes(MessageDeliveryException.class) // <1>
            .excludes(...) // <2>
            .build();

    var retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate(retryPolicy);

    retryTemplate.execute(
            () -> jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...));
----
<1> Specify one or more exception types to include.
<2> Specify one or more exception types to exclude.

[TIP]
====
For advanced use cases, you can specify a custom `Predicate<Throwable>` via the
`predicate()` method in the `RetryPolicy.Builder`, and the predicate will be used to
determine whether to retry a failed operation based on a given `Throwable` – for example,
by checking the cause or the message of the `Throwable`.

Custom predicates can be combined with `includes` and `excludes`; however, custom
predicates will always be applied after `includes` and `excludes` have been applied.
====

The following example demonstrates how to configure a `RetryPolicy` with 5 retry attempts
and an exponential back-off strategy with a bit of jitter.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    var retryPolicy = RetryPolicy.builder()
            .includes(MessageDeliveryException.class)
            .maxAttempts(5)
            .delay(Duration.ofMillis(100))
            .jitter(Duration.ofMillis(10))
            .multiplier(2)
            .maxDelay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
            .build();

    var retryTemplate = new RetryTemplate(retryPolicy);

    retryTemplate.execute(
            () -> jmsClient.destination("notifications").send(...));
----

[TIP]
====
A {spring-framework-api}/core/retry/RetryListener.html[`RetryListener`] can be registered
with a `RetryTemplate` to react to events published during key retry phases (before a
retry attempt, after a retry attempt, etc.), and you can compose multiple listeners via a
{spring-framework-api}/core/retry/support/CompositeRetryListener.html[`CompositeRetryListener`].
====

Although the factory methods and builder API for `RetryPolicy` cover most common
configuration scenarios, you can implement a custom `RetryPolicy` for complete control
over the types of exceptions that should trigger a retry as well as the
{spring-framework-api}/util/backoff/BackOff.html[`BackOff`] strategy to use. Note that you
can also configure a customized `BackOff` strategy via the `backOff()` method in the
`RetryPolicy.Builder`.
